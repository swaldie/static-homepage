	<h1>Sam Waldie</h1>
	<h2>Who?</h2>
	<p>I am a current data engineer and hobbyist sysadmin. All of these things are subjective to having their descriptors switched around at any moment. Denjin is the name of my website and is my handle on a number of applications. It comes from the Japanese 電人, which means "electric person", which seemed like a fitting handle for anyone as fascinated by computers as I am.</p>
	<h2>Where?</h2>
	<p>You can find me at a number of places such as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://swaldie.github.io/">My blog</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://twitter.com/swwaldie">My Twitter</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/swaldie">My Github</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h2>What?</h2>
	<p>I currently maintain a number of projects that keep me occupied outside of work.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://twitch.tv/localonthewhenevers">Local on the Whenevers</a> is a livestreaming project that mashes up vaporwave music alongside video from the <a href="http://www.taiganet.com/">WeatherStar 4000 Simulator</a>. My long term plans for this involve setting up a machine to serve this content 24/7.</li>
		<li>More to come!</li>
